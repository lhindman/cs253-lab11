# Lab12 Guide
## Getting Started

Please watch the [Lab12 Walkthough Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvnIObHoMl8eSDyLlPG-tHfFyBn8qSIY_).

### Code Style Requirements
Please review the [CS253 Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKIpNfkiPpDHEvbx8XSkZbUEUlpt8rnZjkhCSvM-_3A/edit?usp=sharing) and apply it in all lab warmups, lab activities and projects this semester. Coding Style will assessed as part of your lab and project grades.

### Code Quality Requirements
- Code must compile without warnings using the provided Makefile
- Programs must handle unexpected user input and either reprompt (loops) or gracefully exit with a non-zero exit status.
- Programs must handle error conditions gracefully, without crashing, ideally by checking function returns codes (if available) and returning a non-zero exit status.
- Programs should be free of memory related errors, buffer overflows, stack smashing, leaks, etc... Whether the program crashes or not. This will be validated using valgrind.

## Lab Warmup - File System Scanner (part 1)
### Problem Description
Part 1 of the File System Scanner will take the lecture example of the File System Scanner, extend it to use getopt to process command line arguments, and stub out options to allow the user to specify sort and filter options from the commandline. A copy of the File System Scanner example has been provided int he LabWarmup directory.

<br />
1. Modify the File System Scanner to use getopt() functionality
<br /><br />
Maintain existing functionality, however instead of directly reading an optional directory directly from argv[], add a "-d" option with an argument to getopt(). Below is the expected -d usage:

Ex: Listing contents of student home directory using -d
```
./myprog -d /home/student
< too much output >
```
  
<br />
2. Add a "-s" option to enable/disable alphabetical sorting
<br /><br />

Ex: List the contents of student home directory, sorted alphabetically
```
./myprog -s -d /home/student
< too much output, but entries should be sorted alphabetically in ascending order >
```

Ex: List the contents of the current directory, unsorted
```
./myprog 
main.o
.vscode
.
..
main.c
Makefile
myprog
```

Ex: List the contents of the current directory, sorted alphabetically in ascending order
```
./myprog -s
.
..
.vscode
Makefile
main.c
main.o
myprog
```

<br />
3. Release allocated memory. The scandir allocates memory internally that must be freed by the caller to prevent memory leaks. Also make certain to close any files that were opened. Be certain to test all possible commandline enabled/disabled options.
<br /><br />

Ex: Run program in valgrind to verify no memory errors exist
```
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes ./myprog -s -d /usr/bin 
==154461== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==154461== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
==154461== Using Valgrind-3.15.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==154461== Command: ./myprog -s -d /usr/bin 

<<<<<<<< PROGRAM OUTPUT REMOVED >>>>>>>>

==154461== 
==154461== HEAP SUMMARY:
==154461==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==154461==   total heap usage: 1,575 allocs, 1,575 frees, 138,448 bytes allocated
==154461== 
==154461== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==154461== 
==154461== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==154461== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```


### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named LabWarmup and open main.c
2. Enter the program code to create an application as described in the Problem Description.
3. Test the program to ensure it functions as expected.
4. Run the program with valgrind to catch any memory leaks or errors
5. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabWarmup is completed.
6. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
7. Update the Coding Journal with an entry describing your experience using the steps outlined below.


## Lab Activity - File System Scanner (part 2)
### Problem Description
This is a continuation of the File System Scanner from the LabWarmup.  Begin by copying main.c from the LabWarmup into LabActivity.  



<br />
1. Add a "-a" option and a custom filter function to enable/disable displaying hidden files.
<br /><br />
Modify the default filter function to prevent displaying hidden files.  Hidden files are any files or directories whose name begins with a '.'.   Add filter function called showAll() to display all files, including hidden files when the user passes the "-a" option.

Ex: List the contents of student home directory, without hidden files displayed
```
./myprog -d /home/student
<too much output, but should not include files or directories beginning with '.'>
```

Ex: List the contents of the current directory, with hidden files displayed
```
./myprog -d /home/student -a
<too much output, but should include files or directories beginning with '.'>
```

<br />
2. Add a "-f" option and a custom filter function to enable/disable displaying directories
<br /><br />
Add filter function called showFilesOnly() to only display regular files when the user passes the "-f" options. The expected behavior is that -f will also display hidden regular files.

Ex: List the contents of the parent directory (lab root), showing regular files and directories (and all other dirent types) except those that are hidden. 
```
./myprog -d ../ 
README.md
LabGuide
LabActivity
LabWarmup
CodingJournal
cs253-lab12.code-workspace
```

Ex: List the contents of the parent directory, showing only regular files including those that are hidden.
```
./myprog -f -d ../ 
README.md
.gitignore
cs253-lab12.code-workspace
```

NOTE: The expected behavior is that the user will only specify a single filter option([a|f]) at a time from the command-line. If both the -a and -f filter options are specified at the same time, the behavior is undefined.

<br />
3. Add a "-r" and a custom comparison function to sort the list alphabetically, but in the reverse order from the "-s" option.
<br /><br />

Ex: List the contents of the current directory, sorted alphabetically in ascending order
```
./myprog -s
Makefile
main.c
main.o
myprog
```

Ex: List the contents of the current directory, sorted alphabetically in descending order
```
./myprog -r
myprog
main.o
main.c
Makefile
```
<br />
4. Add a "-h" option and a custom usage function that displays all command-line options with short descriptions of each and exits with an exit status of 0.
<br /><br />

Ex: Display a simple help dialog and exist with an exit status of zero
```
./myprog -h
Usage: ./myprog [-d <path>] [-s] [-a] [-f] [-r]
        -d <path> Directory to list the contents of
        -a        Display all files, including hidden files
        -f        Display only regular files
        -r        Display entries alphabetically in descending order
        -s        Display entries alphabetically in ascending order
```


### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named LabActivity and copy main.c from LabWarmup
2. Enter the program code to create an application as described in the Problem Description.
3. Test the program to ensure it functions as expected.
4. Run the program with valgrind to catch any memory leaks or errors
5. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabActivity is completed.
6. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
7. Update the Coding Journal with an entry describing your experience using the steps outlined below.

## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
